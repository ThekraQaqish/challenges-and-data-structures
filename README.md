# Stack with Delete Middle Operation

This project extends a basic `Stack` class by adding a method to **delete the middle element** from the stack. The middle is defined as:

- `length / 2 - 1` when the number of elements is even.
- `Math.floor(length / 2)` when the number of elements is odd.


## ðŸ§  Logic Behind `deleteMiddle()`

1. Count total elements in the stack.
2. Determine the index of the middle element.
3. Pop elements one by one and skip pushing the middle element into a temporary stack.
4. Push elements back from the temporary stack to the original stack (to preserve order).

## ðŸ“¸ Visual Explanation

### Stack Before `deleteMiddle()`

### Stack After `deleteMiddle()`

## ðŸ§ª Example

If the stack contains:

Top â†’ 5 â†’ 4 â†’ 3 â†’ 2 â†’ 1

After calling `.deleteMiddle()`, the stack will become:

Top â†’ 5 â†’ 4 â†’ 2 â†’ 1 (3 was removed)

## âœ… Edge Cases Handled

- If the stack is empty â†’ nothing happens.
- If the stack has only 1 element â†’ it becomes empty.
