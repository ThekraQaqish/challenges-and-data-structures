# Rotate Left Linked List Function

This project implements a function to rotate a singly linked list to the left by a given number of positions `k`.

---

## Functionality

- Takes a singly linked list and an integer `k`.
- Rotates the list left by `k` positions.
- Handles edge cases such as empty list, single-node list, and values of `k` larger than the list length.
- Performs rotation in-place with O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.

---

## How to Use

1. Import the `LinkedList` class and the `rotateLeft` function.
2. Create a linked list and add nodes.
3. Call `rotateLeft(list, k)` to rotate the list.
4. Use the linked list's methods to display or manipulate the rotated list.

## Testing with Jest

- Jest tests cover different cases including empty list, single-node list, rotation by zero, rotation by `k > length`.
- To run tests:
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```
