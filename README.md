# MinStack

## Overview
This project implements a custom `MinStack` class that extends a basic `Stack` structure. It supports common stack operations (`push`, `pop`, `peek`) along with retrieving the minimum value in constant time using an auxiliary stack.


---

## ðŸ§ª Features

- `push(value)` â€“ Pushes value onto the stack.
- `pop()` â€“ Removes and returns the top node.
- `peek()` â€“ Returns the value at the top of the stack.
- `getMin()` â€“ Returns the minimum value in the stack in **O(1)** time.

## ðŸ§ª Testing

- Tests are written using **Jest**.
- Each class (`Node`, `Stack`, `MinStack`) has its own dedicated test suite.

To run only MinStack tests:
npx jest tests/minstack.test.js
